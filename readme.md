<b><u>Mission in doing CodeForces</u></b>
<ul>
<li>To learn Python from scratch</li>
<li>To grow better at recognizing greedy algorithms</li>  
<li>To expand my knowledge on unknown algorithms</li>  
<li>To increase my "field of view" on how problems can be solved</li>  
<li>To complete at least five programs every weekday except Friday (if possible)</li>
</ul>

<b>IDEs/Editors Used</b>
<ul>
<li>PyDev (Eclipse's Python plugin)</li>  
<li>IDLE</li>
</ul>

If you're trying to gauge my current skill, consult the log and review the most recent programs.

In general, the higher you go up in lexographical order of the suffix letter, the harder the problem.
<ol>
<li>158B is harder than 158A</li>
<li>Example 2: 158B is harder than 1000A</li> 
<li>Example 3: 1000A is as hard as 158A</li>
</ol>

<b>HUGE NOTE</b>: I rarely comment my solutions, as I'm going for speed when writing these programs (as if I was in competition).
		If you would like me to run through my solutions for you, let me know!
