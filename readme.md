<b><u>Mission in doing CodeForces</u></b>
<ul>
<li>To learn Python from scratch</li>
<li>To grow better at recognizing greedy algorithms</li>  
<li>To expand my knowledge on unknown algorithms</li>  
<li>To increase my "field of view" on how problems can be solved</li>  
<li>To complete at least five programs every weekday except Friday (if possible)</li>
</ul>

<b>IDEs/Editors Used</b>
<ul>
<li>PyDev (Eclipse's Python plugin)</li>  
<li>IDLE</li>
</ul>

In general, the higher you go up in lexographical order of the suffix letter, the harder the problem.  
Examples:
<ol>
<li>158B is harder than 158A</li>
<li>158B is harder than 1000A</li> 
<li>1000A is as hard as 158A</li>
</ol>

<b>HUGE NOTE</b>: I rarely comment my solutions, as I'm going for speed when writing these programs (as if I was in competition).
		This is not how I program in a practical setting. Please keep that in mind. :)
