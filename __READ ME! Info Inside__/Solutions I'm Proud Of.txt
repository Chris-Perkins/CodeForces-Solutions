782D - Innokenty and a Soccer League
	This problem was initially given to me during my second programming competition on CodeForces.
	I felt as though I struggled with recursion a few months ago. Mainly as I always failed to test base cases.
	Initially, I took a brute force approach which initially timed out (see http://codeforces.com/contest/782/submission/25270109).
	I took a step back from the problem for awhile because of that, as I thought the solution I had was relatively smart. It was recursive brute force, and it worked. But, it was still brute force.
	I came back to this problem with a completely new approach: I would implement backtracking with a failure point. The failure point being that only "swap" of names could be done per name (or index, in my thoughts).
	After feeling as though recursion was a weak point of mine, I managed to write my new solution in one sitting without ever testing it. I ran it once, and was in disbelief when it worked the first time.
	Hopefully this feeling of disbelief will soon become normal.
	I'm particularly proud of this program because of the way it handles all of the cases by referring to its own protocols.
	For code written at 1 AM, I am extremely proud of it. It's not often you get a program working first try at 2 AM, let alone a recursive problem.

	If you would like to learn about the exact process my program goes through in order to produce the answer, please feel free to ask :)
