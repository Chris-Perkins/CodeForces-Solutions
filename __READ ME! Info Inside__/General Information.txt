HUGE NOTE: I rarely comment my solutions, as I'm going for speed when writing these programs (as if I was in competition).
		If you would like me to run through my solutions for you, let me know!

If you're trying to gauge my current skill, consult the log and review the most recent programs.

In general, the higher you go up in lexographical order of the suffix letter, the harder the problem.
	Example 1: 158B is harder than 158A
	Example 2: 158B is harder than 1000A
	Example 3: 1000A is as hard as 158A

IDEs/Editors Used:
	PyDev (Eclipse's Python plugin)
	IDLE

Mission in doing CodeForce:
	1) To grow better at recognizing greedy algorithms
	2) To expand my knowledge on unknown algorithms
	3) To increase my "field of view" on how problems can be solved
	4) Learn Python from scratch
	5) Complete at least five programs every weekday except Friday (if possible)
