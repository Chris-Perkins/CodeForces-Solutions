My CodeForces profile: http://codeforces.com/profile/Christopher-Perkins#

If you want to see my submissions as they were submitted, you can check the files in this repository or 
	the "Submissions" tab on my CodeForces profile.
If you're trying to gauge my current skill, consult the log and review the most recent programs.

In general, in terms of difficulty, the higher you go up in lexographical order, the harder the problem.
	Example: 158B is harder than 158A
